# diachronic-register-service

This repository contains the source code for a diachronic and synchronic register search system for modern and contemporary Japanese corpora.

##  Abstract

The diachronic register service system is being developed to provide a convenient and insightful way of visualizing and analysis of over a century (1874--2008) of Japanese language change. Consequently, its aim is to simplify investigations into diachronic language change as well as register variation in Japanese by providing a uniﬁed and sophisticated metadata-based search interface over several historical as well as contemporary corpora.

## Development

Development is done using [boot](https://getboot.com).

## Trying it out

A local copy may be run, provided you have Java and the boot toolchain installed. Additionally, it is necessary to download one or more corpora and install the native NLP toolchain for Japanese. An easier way is to visit the (current) [online demo](http://chiron.lang.osaka-u.ac.jp) (may be unavailable currently).
